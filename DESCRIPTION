Description: This package is intended to be used to identify the sample a cell originated from, where cells from a male and female organism were mixed before 10X single nuclei sequencing. Sex assignment of cells are based on probabilities from density estimation using a Gaussian finite mixture model. This package was developed to take a Seurat object post dimensional reduction clustering as input.
